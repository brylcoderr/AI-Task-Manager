# AI Task Manager

This project is an AI-powered Task Manager application built with Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript. The application is designed to help users efficiently manage tasks with features like setting priorities, categories, and due dates. The app includes a user-friendly interface and integrates AI-driven features to optimize task management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **Next.js**: A React-based framework that enables server-side rendering, static generation, and optimized performance.
  - **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality with static typing, ensuring code robustness and easier maintenance.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Provides a reliable server-side runtime environment for handling API requests and managing database interactions.

- **Database**:
  - *[Database of your choice]* (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store and manage task data.

## Features

### 1. Task Management
   - Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
